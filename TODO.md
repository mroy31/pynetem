Propose a graphical UI based on qt5

Problem to investigate :
  - on host routes with reject|mod|dyn|reinstate are not saved

Be more robust during save/load process :
  - handle save/load error on host configuration
  - docker : add an option to share folder with host

Other fixes :
  - complete doc
     - integrate bridge connection to topology example
